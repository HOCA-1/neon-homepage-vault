## 🔌 Community Plugins

These community plugins are used to enhance the dashboard experience:

Adds image banners to the top of your notes.  
Great for visual sections like dashboards and MOCs.

> 📐 To fix spacing issues between banners and note content, install the **beta version** using [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

Combined with `Dashboard Searchbar.css`, it mimics a floating search input field at the top of your layout.
